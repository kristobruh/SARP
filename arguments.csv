### DOWNLOAD PARAMETERS ###

# Strt and end dates for which images are downloaded, in format YYYY-MM-DD.
start	2021-03-01
end	2021-03-10

# Whether observations are downloaded only for certain period for each year, eg: 15,200. If not desired (all available data from start to end), set to none.
season	none

# Determines the beam mode of the instrument. For S1 possible options are: EW, IW, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, WV. This is often best set at IW.
beamMode	IW

# Whether observations are captured from ascending or descending track. Depending on what you want, both ASCENDING and DESCENDING work.
flightDirection	ASCENDING

# Polarization of the images. VV,VV+VH is valid in Finland. Other options are: VV, VV+VH, Dual VV, VV+VH, Dual HV, Dual HH, HH, HH+HV, VV, Dual VH
polarization	VV,VV+VH

# Whether images are downloaded as real or imaginary. GRD_HD for Ground Range detected, SLC for complex and polSAR images.
processingLevel	SLC

# Amount of simultaneous downloads. 8 is good.
processes	8



### PROCESSING PARAMETERS ###

# You can use one of three preset processing pipelines: GRD, SLC, polSAR (case sensitive). Note that for GRD, processingLevel should be set at GRD_HD, and for SLC and polSAR at SLC.
# Alternatively, you can set 'process' as False, and define the processing parameters yourself below.

process	polSAR

# Name of the column which identifies each polygon. If you're not sure what your identifier column is, just run the process with some name, and the columns will be printed.
identifierColumn	PLOHKO

# Example processing pipelines:
# GRD: applyOrbitFile, thermalNoiseRemoval, calibration, speckleFiltering, terrainCorrection, linearToDb.
# SLC: slcSplit, applyOrbitFile, calibration, slcDeburst, speckleFiltering, terrainCorrection.

### POST-PROCESSING PARAMETERS ###
timeseries	True

# Whether several images are averaged in timeseries analysis. Usually should be set at False, unless you know you want to average images.
movingAverage	False
movingAverageWindow	2

# If reflector is enabled, the code finds a brightest spot in the image and calculates timeseries on that one spot.
reflector	False

# Weather analysis is currently disabled.
downloadWeather	False
